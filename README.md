# Bluesend

A simple audio plugin to send raw audio data to any connected bluetooth device (i.e Raspberry Pi).

Based on [WDL / IPlug (Oli Larkin Edition)][wdl-ol-github].

Part of my SD #22 District Project Scholarship submission.

## Links to SDKs (for future reference)

- [VST SDKs][vst-sdks-download] &mdash; Contains VST2 and VST3 SDKs. I haven't tested the included ASIO SDK. Feel free to try it out yourself, and tell me what happens!
- [ASIO SDK][rtaudio-with-asio-sdk-download] &mdash; The RtAudio download contains a working ASIO SDK (for standalone builds on Windows). Use that.
